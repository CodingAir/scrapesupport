# scrapesupport
A Discord bot to scrape textfiles from messages and put them to pastebin.com. Intended to use on support servers to help users read textfiles on mobile.

# installation and requirements

After cloning or downloading the repository, you need Python 3.5.3 or higher. To install all dependencies, just issue:

```powershell
pip -r requirements.txt
```

You also need to make a copy of `example-config.yml` as  `config.yml` and configure the bot. The rest works as normal for a Discord Bot. You can also just invite the bot ;)
